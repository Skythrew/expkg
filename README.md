# EXPKG - The Ultimate Package Downloader/Updater

## What's this ?

This is a very simple project, mostly aimed to satisfy my own needs of having to automate
the whole process of downloading/updating external packages from sources which are not directly
proper repos, such as GitHub for example.

Thus, EXPKG is a *simple* Python tool/script which is able to manage your external package files in a clean
way by using the famous `nvchecker` tool to track new releases. It is basically a useful wrapper around nvchecker.

I hope you'll enjoy it!
